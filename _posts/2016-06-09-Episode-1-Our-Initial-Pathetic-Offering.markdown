Episode 1: Our Initial Pathetic Offering is live and available for download <a href = "bit.ly/1WH3dDM">here</a>. We attempt to discuss tech IPOs but actually end up only discussing two or three of them, mislead our nonexistent listeners about Google's investment in Lyft (that never happened), talk about a bad arcade/go-karting place you shouldn't visit, and spend tens of minutes rambling about things without actually saying anything of value. Enjoy*!






*<sup>We say this as if somebody will actually be around to enjoy our modest efforts.</sup>
