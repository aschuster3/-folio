<p>In this episode, we talk about the rise of Uber and Airbnb, bemoan the failure of our own beloved startup, invent a new startup idea, and do our best to keep things family-friendlyattempt to discuss tech IPOs but actually end up only discussing two or three of them, mislead our nonexistent listeners about Google's investment in Lyft (that never happened), talk about a bad arcade/go-karting place you shouldn't visit, and spend tens of minutes rambling about things without actually saying anything of value. Enjoy*!</p>
